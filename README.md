# recipe-manager-mongodb-java
A Java application for managing recipes, including adding, updating, and deleting recipes. The application features a GUI built with Scene Builder and utilizes MongoDB's document-based structure for recipe storage.

## Features
- **Add new recipes**: Enter recipe details such as name, ingredients, instructions, and tags.
- **Update and delete recipes**: Modify existing recipes or remove them from the database.

## Further Improvements
- Exception Handling: Add proper exception handling for data checking when entering or editing recipes.

- Improved GUI Feedback: Add success and error messages to provide feedback on user actions.
- View Tab: Implement a view-only mode to allow users to read recipes without editing them.
- Responsive UI: Make the GUI more responsive and intuitive, especially on different screen sizes.
